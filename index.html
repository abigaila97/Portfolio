    <h2 id="#About">About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Abigail! I am an illustrator and front end developer.</p>
    <p>Art has always been a passion of mine. Starting out as a child with crayons and growing up to be an illustrator with a variety of mediums.
        My interest in web development started when I had to create a portfolio for my art. Using templates was easy but I could never get my portfolio to look the way I wanted it.
        So, I decided that I would learn the necessary skills to create my own website.
